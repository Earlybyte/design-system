# Why UI-Library

As of now no function has been defined within ITCH to standardize the look&feel of all digital touchpoints (website, calculators, emails, documents) with the user. This leads to following problems: 

* Design across most web-applications not CI-compliant 
* Behavior of web-applications partly very different (interactions, components etc.)
* Language not consistent & target group specific

-> Negative impact for the customer journey of our user
